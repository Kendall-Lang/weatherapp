Simple Weather App

This program is a weather application that displays rudamentary weather stats to the user when prompted with a city. The back-end is programmed in Java and uses Spring Boot to push the progream to a website. I learned HTML and CSS to create a simple front-end
that the user can interact with to put in a city and see the results. The request itself is gathered through JavaScript and uses OpenWeatherApp's weather API to get realtime data
